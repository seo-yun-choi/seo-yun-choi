### 🤖 Hi there! 

This is the place where I attempt to create stuff as an aspiring developer while pretending that I do in fact know what I am doing 😹

- 🔭  I’m currently working on a fun little **blogging website project** 
- 🌱  I’m currently learning **Java** and **Python**
- 💬  Idk much about code (yet) but I'm fluent in Korean and English -- feel free to reach out to me!
- 📫  E-mail: seoyunchoi@hufs.ac.kr
- 💁‍♀️  Pronouns: She/Her 
- ⚡  Fun fact: Every fall I revisit my comfort video game called Night In The Woods
